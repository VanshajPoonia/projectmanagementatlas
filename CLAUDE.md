# Platform rebuild — plan & guardrails

**Consolidated 2026-07-24:** all work now happens in this one folder
(`/Users/vanshajpoonia/Code/Project manager`) on `main`. The former separate `pm-platform`
worktree (branch `platform`) was fast-forward-merged into `main` and is deprecated — do not use it.
`main` is both the live app AND where the rebuild continues.

**Single organization, not multi-tenant SaaS (owner ruling, 2026-07-24):** this product is being
built for **exactly one organization, permanently** — Bobby's company (business units SRG/AGC). It
is **not** being built as a product other companies sign up to use, and nothing below should be read
as heading toward that. Full context: `docs/product/master-product-context.md`'s reconciliation
banner and `docs/product/master-prompt.md`'s note on PROMPT 3. This file used to describe a
multi-tenant rebuild (organizations + org_members + tenant-scoped RLS); that plan is **superseded** —
see "What this branch is for" below for the corrected shape.

## ⛔ Before running ANY SQL

This folder's `.env.local` points at the **separate dev Supabase project** (ref `pxzpewaerhjwnwsbaklc`),
a full clone of production, so local dev and migrations run against the sandbox by default. Production
(ref `icyfluwgyuimhwlddjyy`) is the live database — reachable **only** through a deliberate opt-in
(`--allow-prod`, see below), never by accident.

Any migration that rewrites RLS policies or changes constraints on existing tables is destructive
until proven otherwise. Default to the **dev sandbox only** — never prod — for anything beyond a
purely additive `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` / new table.

**Every write-path script must import and call the guard from `scripts/guard-db.mjs` before opening
any connection:** `assertDevDatabase()` (dev-only, no opt-in — for the app/dev path and the isolation
harness) or `assertMigrationTarget({ allowProd })` (the migration runner; prod requires an explicit
`--allow-prod` flag and prints a loud banner). Only additive, non-destructive migrations may ever use
`--allow-prod`; destructive migrations must not. Run
`pnpm guard` any time to see which project the current environment resolves to. This applies to
`psql`, the Supabase SQL editor, and any migration runner — if a task seems to need a migration
applied and the script doesn't yet call the guard, add the guard call first, don't skip it.

## What this branch is for

`main` is a working PM tool for **one company** (Bobby's — business units SRG/AGC). This branch
matures it: real team/project-level access control, a canonical work-item domain, more views, and
the marketing/AI differentiation — **for this one org, not as a multi-tenant product.** The gap is
not features — `main` already has tasks, multi-assignee, kanban + list, calendar, comments,
attachments, tags, activity log, admin-managed statuses, reports, search, chat, bookmarks, and an AI
assistant with function-calling over live data.

The gap is three structural things.

### 1. No team- or project-level access control

`boards`, `tasks`, `tags`, `task_statuses` are one flat pool inside the org — every authenticated
user can read all of them (`USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL)`, or `is_board_member()` for the private-board
exception only). That's fine for full members today, but it blocks two things the roadmap already
wants: **Guests** (limited external collaborators) and a **Client portal** (FEATURES.md Phase 7) —
both need a user scoped to *specific* boards/teams, not full-company read access, without inventing
a second, parallel membership system.

Note: the `companies` table (SRG/AGC, `scripts/056_companies.sql`) is **not** a tenant and never was
— it is a business-unit label used by the marketing calendar. Do not overload it into anything more.

### 2. Statuses have two competing sources of truth

`task_statuses` (a real table) and board `columns`, reconciled by fuzzy string matching in
`lib/task-status.ts`:

```ts
if (status.includes('progress') || columnTitle.includes('going')) return 'in_progress'
```

This worked by accident because this team names columns "In Progress" / "Ongoing" — a differently
named column (e.g. "WIP") would have silently misclassified every task on it. **Fixed** (migration
`063`): `columns.status_key → task_statuses(key)` is now the source of truth; the normalizer reads
the FK first and keeps string matching only as a legacy fallback for un-backfilled columns.

### 3. Feature access is hardcoded to one person's email

- `components/user/user-dashboard.tsx` — `isKaylaMarketingUser`, gates a whole module, also sets the accent colour
- `components/marketing/marketing-calendar.tsx` — `KAYLA_EMAIL`, hard-fails with "Kayla profile is not ready yet."
- `lib/display-text.ts` — strips strings specific to `Marketing Project Management.xlsx`

This is a real problem independent of the tenancy question above: today only one specific person
(`kayla@goatlasgo.us`) can ever use the marketing module, by construction. Fixing it means a real
module-activation + role system (Phase 1 below), not a per-org one — there is only one org.

## Plan

**Phase 0 — safety net (do first). ✅ DONE.** No tests, no CI, and 59 hand-applied SQL files with no
record of what had been applied. Built: `scripts/migrate.mjs` (+ `public.applied_migrations`, all 63
files baselined/applied) and `scripts/guard-db.mjs` (shared allowlist guard, dev-sandbox-by-default).
`scripts/check-isolation.mjs` was originally built as a **cross-tenant** isolation gate (two users in
different orgs, assert zero shared rows) — that framing is now moot under the single-org ruling
above. It is kept as-is (harmless, still passes) but is not gating anything meaningful anymore;
`scripts/check-board-roles.mjs` (below) is the harness that actually matters now.

**Phase 1 — plumbing.** In this order:
- **B. Status FK. ✅ DONE (migration `063`).** See "Statuses" above.
- **A. Teams, roles & real access control. Migrations `064`–`067`.** ⚠️ **"schema + UI" below is
  accurate only for `board_members.role` — `teams` itself is schema-only, zero UI** (no creation
  page, no membership management, no nav/sidebar presence; confirmed by repo-wide grep, no
  `.from('teams')`/`team_members` call site outside the migration file). Corrected 2026-07-24 after
  this heading previously overclaimed teams as done; don't read "DONE (schema + UI)" as covering
  teams UI in any future session.
  - `teams(id, name, color, position)` + `team_members(team_id, user_id)` — no `team_role` column;
    kept simpler than first sketched (plain membership only). Add a role column later if a real
    need shows up — don't build it speculatively. **No UI consumes this table yet.**
  - `board_members.role` (`member` | `guest` | `client`, default `'member'`, migration `065`) on the
    **existing** table from `049_board_privacy.sql` — no parallel membership system. Enforced
    server-side: `guest`/`client` can view a board's tasks but not create/edit/delete them
    (`private.can_manage_task` + the tasks INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies, `065` + `067`). Verified
    by `pnpm check:board-roles` (mirrors `check-isolation.mjs`'s throwaway-user pattern) — 9/9 checks
    pass, including a `member`-role control case proving the restriction is role-specific.
  - `067` also closed a **pre-existing** gap found while verifying `065`: the tasks INSERT policy
    never checked board privacy at all (`061` added that check to SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE only, INSERT
    was missed) — fixed in the same migration since it's the same policy.
  - **UI wired (no `lib/permissions.ts` added)** — `board-view.tsx`/`task-card.tsx`/`task-detail-modal.tsx`
    already had inline `canEdit`/`canDelete`/`canEditDueDate` checks (explicitly commented as
    mirroring each other); threaded a new `boardRole` prop (fetched server-side in
    `app/dashboard/board/[id]/page.tsx` + `app/admin/board/[id]/page.tsx` from the caller's own
    `board_members` row) into all three instead of adding a competing abstraction. Guest/client now
    also can't see the "Add task" button. Browser-verified with Playwright against the dev server: a
    real guest-role user sees the task but its title/description/due-date inputs are `disabled`
    (same existing UI convention as the priority/status/visibility selects), the Add-task button is
    gone, zero console errors; a plain member (no `board_members` row) is fully unaffected. Test
    fixtures created and torn down via the service role, dev sandbox only.
- **C. Modules. ✅ DONE (schema + UI) — migration `066`.** `app_modules(module_key, enabled, config
  jsonb)`, a singleton (no `org_id`), seeded with every current module `enabled=true` — nothing
  changes for anyone by default. `lib/modules.ts` has the registry (`useAppModules` hook +
  `isModuleEnabled`, mirrors `lib/use-task-statuses.ts`). Wired into both `user-dashboard.tsx` and
  `admin-dashboard.tsx` — their tab lists and sidebar sections now gate on `isModuleEnabled(...)`
  (marketing stays additionally gated by the existing Kayla/admin check — untouched, that's §3/Phase
  2 territory). Browser-verified: nav renders identically to before (all seeded enabled=true).
  **Not wired:** the floating `AiChatWidget` and the embedded `BookmarksSection` rail render
  unconditionally in all three dashboard shells (user/admin/super-admin) — `ai_assistant` and
  `bookmarks` exist as toggleable rows in `app_modules` but aren't consumed at those render sites
  yet. Scoped out because it touches three more large files; pick up if a super_admin actually needs
  to turn either off.

**Phase 2 — de-hardcode.** Remove the three items in §3 above. Members/guests/clients are added to
the one existing org directly (no "create org" step — there's nothing to create).

**Phase 3 — the risk story.** Where it stops being a task tracker and starts answering
*"what is at risk?"*:
- Subtasks — `tasks.parent_task_id` (nullable, self-referencing). Board queries need
  `WHERE parent_task_id IS NULL` or subtasks render as loose cards.
- Dependencies + blockers — `task_dependencies(blocker_id, blocked_id)`, `tasks.blocked_reason`,
  `blocked_since`. Log transitions to the existing `task_activity`.
- In-app notification inbox — `notifications(user_id, type, entity, read_at)`. Split
  *action required* / *FYI* from day one. Email prefs already exist; a durable inbox does not.
- "What should I work on next" — **zero schema**, all inputs are already in `myTasks`.
- Milestones — `milestones(board_id, title, due_date, status)`.
- `tasks.estimate_hours` — ship the column early so data accumulates before workload is built.
- Project health — `boards.health` + `health_note`, **manual first**. An auto-status that is wrong
  destroys trust in every other number shown.

**Phase 4 — earn it.** Workload, saved views (`reports-view.tsx` already holds ~10 filter states in
`useState`), custom fields, the **client portal UX** built on top of Phase 1-A's `board_members.role`
(schema already lands in Phase 1-A; this phase is the client-facing screens/flows), and three
hardcoded automations on Vercel Cron — overdue → notify owner; all subtasks done → complete parent;
recurring task spawn (the `is_recurring` columns from `scripts/025_*.sql` are currently unused).

## Explicitly not building

Multi-tenant/organization-switching machinery (see the single-org ruling above), docs/wiki +
collaborative editing, Gantt/timeline, offline support, a generic automation rules engine, and more
than two integrations (Google Calendar one-way export, Slack notifications). Each is a product
rather than a feature, and none serves the goal of reducing time spent *managing* work.

## People (current dev sandbox, for reference — query `profiles` for current truth)

`bobby@goatlasgo.us` (Bobby Shanks) and `kayla@goatlasgo.us` (Kayla Viehland) both hold platform role
`super_admin`, deliberately — this is not "one vendor account," don't consolidate to one. Kayla's
separate hardcoded marketing-module gating (§3 above) is unrelated to her platform role and unaffected
by any role work in Phase 1.

## Conventions

- Migrations: numbered SQL in `scripts/`, continuing from `068` (`067` is the last applied file).
  Wrap in `BEGIN; … COMMIT;`,
  use `IF NOT EXISTS`, and write the intent as a comment header — match the style of
  `047`, `049`, `056`.
- Do not add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` to commits in this repo.
- `.vercel/` was deliberately not copied from `main` — this branch must not deploy over the
  live Vercel project. It needs its own.
